# SupportTools

Description:
BinStorage is a simple application that helps users keep track of items stored in various containers. The application is built using Visual Basic for the front-end (aspx) and code-behind (aspx.vb) and SQL Server for backend storage. This is the first application I have created in my free time, and the only project I have completed on my support tools.

Functionality:
The application allows users to add, update, and delete items they have stored in specified bins. Users can also assign any number of categories to each item to make finding them easier in the future. All bins, categories, and items are stored in SQL Server, along with stored procedures that handle the adding, updating, and deleting functions of the application.

File Structure:
The files containing all the code I wrote in Visual Basic are located in BinStorage.aspx and BinStorage.aspx.vb.
